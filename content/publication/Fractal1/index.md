abstract: 'The concept of the $p$th variation of a continuous function $f$ along
a refining sequence of partitions is the key to a pathwise It√¥ integration theory
with integrator $f$. Here, we analyze the $p$th variation of a class of fractal functions, containing both the Takagi‚Äìvan der Waerden and Weierstra√ü functions.
We use a probabilistic argument to show that these functions have linear pth
variation for a parameter $p ‚â• 1$, which can be interpreted as the reciprocal
Hurst parameter of the function. It is shown, moreover, that if functions are
constructed from (a skewed version of) the tent map, then the slope of the $p$th
variation can be computed from the $p$th moment of a (non-symmetric) infinite
Bernoulli convolution. Finally, we provide a recursive formula of these moments and use it to discuss the existence and non-existence of a signed version
of the $p$th variation, which occurs in pathwise It√¥ calculus when $p ‚â• 3$ is an
odd integer.'
