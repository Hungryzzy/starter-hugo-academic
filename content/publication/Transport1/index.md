abstract: 'We propose a general framework of mass transport between vectorvalued measures, which will be called simultaneous transport. The new
framework is motivated by the need to transport resources of different
types simultaneously, i.e., in single trips, from specified origins to destinations. In terms of matching, one needs to couple two groups, e.g., buyers
and sellers, by equating supplies and demands of different goods at the
same time. The mathematical structure of simultaneous transport is very
different from the classic setting of optimal transport, leading to many
new challenges. The Monge and Kantorovich formulations are contrasted
and connected. Existence and uniqueness of the simultaneous transport
and duality formulas are established, and a notion of Wasserstein distance
in this setting is introduced. In particular, the duality theorem gives rise
to a labour market equilibrium model where each worker has several types
of skills and each firm seeks to employ these skills at different levels.'
