abstract: 'We propose a new tractable general framework for sorting - composite sorting. Composite sorting comprises of (1) distinct workers being assigned to the same job and (2) a given worker type simultaneously being part of both positive and negative sorting. We show that composite sorting generically arises in a class of sorting models when fixed investments can mitigate the variable costs of mismatch. We develop a complete characterization of equilibrium sorting as well as the corresponding equilibrium wages. Wages exhibit a local hierarchical structure meaning the relative wages depend solely on sorting patterns within narrow skill groups. Using this framework, we study within-job wage dispersion and demonstrate that quantitatively composite sorting may explain a sizable portion of wage dispersion within occupations in the United States.'
