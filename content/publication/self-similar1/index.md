abstract: 'In this paper we study the self-similar processes with stationary increments in a
discrete-time setting. Different from the continuous-time case, it is shown that the
scaling function of such a process may not take the form of a power function $b(a) = a
^{H}$. More precisely, its scaling function can belong to one of three types, among which
one type is degenerate, one type has a continuous-time counterpart, while the other
type is new and unique for the discrete-time setting. We then focus on this last
type of processes, construct two classes of examples, and prove a special spectral
representation result for the processes of this type. We also derive basic properties of
discrete-time self-similar processes with stationary increments of different types.'
